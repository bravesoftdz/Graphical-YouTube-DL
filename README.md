<h1>Graphical YouTube-DL v2.0.6</h1>
Graphical YouTube-DL takes the command line youtube-dl for windows to a graphical interface

<h2>How to install & use</h2>
- If this is your first time using this you need to download both the installer and the client.
- After you used the installer you need to run the client as admin then press the "Check For Updates" button and update youtube-dl.exe
- Done and ready for use!

<h2>IMPORTANT!</h2>
I did not make the youtube-dl commandline tool nor ffmpeg or ffprobe

<h2>Graphical YouTube-DL Client v2.0.6</h2>
This is only the client and not the commandline tool.

<h2>youtube-dl.exe installer</h2>
This is only the installer for the commandline tool and only needs to be downloaded once as it has a built in updater.
